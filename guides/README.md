2. Follow **Project Structure** to create the folder layout
3. Use **Database Setup** to configure Prisma
4. Build your **Backend** following the API patterns
5. Create your **Frontend** using the component patterns
6. Apply **Code Organization** standards throughout
7. Implement **Authentication** using the proven patterns

## 💡 For AI Assistants

When using these guides to build a new application:
- Follow the commented code patterns shown in each guide
- Use the same folder structure for consistency
- Implement features in the order presented
- Apply the header-style comments for better code organization
- Reference the example code snippets as templates

## 📝 Notes
